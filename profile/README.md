## Project Overview
DentAssist is a machine learning-based application designed to help users identify oral health problems by analyzing photos of their mouths. It provides information, suggested medications, nearby clinics, and relevant medical articles to guide users in managing their dental health. The project aims to improve accessibility to dental care, especially in underserved areas, contributing positively to public health.

## How did our team come up with this project?
Our team recognized the significant need for improved oral health care in Indonesia. Advances in machine learning and image processing presented an opportunity to create an easily accessible, proactive, and affordable dental health monitoring tool.
